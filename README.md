# cysec-primer-course
CySec Primer is a course Luke 'syreal' Jones created to teach the very basics of cyber security using picoCTF.

This repository is a public hosting of an easily distributed package of the course materials. This material was created initially for Pennsylvania's Governor's School for the Sciences, for the Core Computer Science course. It was made with support also from CyLab at Carnegie Mellon University.

It is meant mostly as inspiration and an example of a course made by someone with both interest and experience in cyber security education, capture-the-flag competitions, and computer security engineering and research.
